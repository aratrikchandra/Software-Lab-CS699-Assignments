Question 5
        5)
Now add to the previous program to make a "dictionary" or a "hashtable" which maps the column name to the column index. To construct this index, you have to use the header row, which you can identify in the program as having "SNo" as the first column value. The program should then loop through the dictionary to print each column name and corresponding index. Index starts at zero.
What you are expected to learn: constructing and looping through dictionary or hashtable structures in python
