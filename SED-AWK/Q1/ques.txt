Question 1
        Use sed commands to do this exercise. If you are not using the sed command to do this you will get zero marks.

Write a bash script(mcdonald.sh) which prints McDonald rhymes. As stdin input, a sequence of lines, of animal:sound is given. And out comes the rhyme. You may have to use the 'cut' command, and of course a loop to read through the input and print.

For Example:

Input is:
            pig:oink
            cow:moo
            dog:bow

Output is:
            Old McDonald had a farm ei-ei-o
            On that farm he had a pig ei-ei-o
            With a oink-oink here, oink-oink there
            Here a oink there a oink, everywhere oink-oink

            Old McDonald had a farm ei-ei-o
            On that farm he had a cow ei-ei-o
            With a moo-moo here, moo-moo there
            Here a moo there a moo, everywhere moo-moo

            Old McDonald had a farm ei-ei-o
            On that farm he had a dog ei-ei-o
            With a bow-bow here, bow-bow there
            Here a bow there a bow, everywhere bow-bow

            Old McDonald had a farm ei-ei-o


To run the script:
        ./mcdonald.sh < input.txt
