Question 5
        1. Study the format of the file /etc/sample.txt which stores information about various user accounts. It includes various dummy user accounts too: these have user ids, but they are not allowed to login. All other users having something other than “/bin/false” as login shell are valid users and are allowed to login. This is indicated by the setting "/bin/false" for the login shell.
Write an awk script to print the user ids (the first field) of all dummy accounts whose shell is "/bin/false" and also print the maximum uid among all those user ids.
The Sample Input File is -
UserID	Name	Designation	loginShell
10001	ajay	manager	/bin/false
1001	sunil	clerk		/bin/false
101	varun	manager	Valid
60123	amit	manager	/bin/false
401	tarun	peon		Valid

And after running the script the output should be - 
10001
1001
60123
60123
	
	Usage : ./dummy_accounts.awk sample.txt
