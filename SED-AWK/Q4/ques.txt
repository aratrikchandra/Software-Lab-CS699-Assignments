Question 4
        Write an awk script for the McDonald rhyme. Your output should be the same as the mcdonald.sh case, including spacings and the last line ending the rhyme.

For Example:

Input is:
            pig:oink
            cow:moo
            dog:bow

Output is:
            Old McDonald had a farm ei-ei-o
            On that farm he had a pig ei-ei-o
            With a oink-oink here, oink-oink there
            Here a oink there a oink, everywhere oink-oink

            Old McDonald had a farm ei-ei-o
            On that farm he had a cow ei-ei-o
            With a moo-moo here, moo-moo there
            Here a moo there a moo, everywhere moo-moo

            Old McDonald had a farm ei-ei-o
            On that farm he had a dog ei-ei-o
            With a bow-bow here, bow-bow there
            Here a bow there a bow, everywhere bow-bow

            Old McDonald had a farm ei-ei-o


To run the script:
        ./mcdonald.awk input.txt
