# This script must take a single argument, a file input.  It must run
# the script hp-count.awk on that input, and use the output to extract
# the lines corresponding to the three students with the maximum
# negative (magnitude wise) house points.

# You need not check that a single argument is given, you can assume
# that a single argument will be given.

# Marks: 3, 2 HP
# 2 marks for correctness
# 1 mark, 2HP for single line solution (can use pipes, but no multiple
# bash statements)

# START

awk -f marks-count.awk $1  | sort -n -t "," -k 5 | head -3
