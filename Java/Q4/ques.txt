Question 4
        Now in Parse2.java again read the log file and parse each line. You would have to use BufferedReader, String, and StringTokenizer (from the java library) as part of this process.
Insert the entries which you have read into an appropriate data structure, from the existing collections framework. While inserting, ensure that duplicates are not stored (hint: use something which implements the Set interface or its extension).
After finishing reading the file, print the log entries onto stdout, in the same 5-column format as the input file. You must print the entries in increasing order of node ids. And within the same node id, you must print entries in order of increasing log entry number.
In doing this, you must use the for each loop, or an appropriate iterator.
To achieve the correct ordering of entries in the output, you must use an object called Log to represent each log entry, and the object must implement the Comparable interface.
