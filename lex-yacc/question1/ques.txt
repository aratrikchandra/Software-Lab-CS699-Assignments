        For each of the exercises in this lab, you should use the file names as given in the solution template.

Some of the solutions may be available online, even in the tutorials provided as references. But you are advised to code them from scratch (no cut-paste) for understanding. Any cut-paste will be detrimental to your learning and will affect your performance in exams for sure.

Toy exercises to get warmed up:
a. count-lines.l Write a lex file to count the number of lines in the input.
b. count-lwc.l Write a lex file to count the number of lines, words, and characters in the input. A word is contiguous string of alphanumeric characters (alphabets and numbers only). Note that this definition is different from that used by the 'wc' program. 
c. count-num.l Write a lex file to count the number of numbers appearing in the input. Count the number of integers (without a decimal) separately from the number of floating point numbers (with a decimal, and at least one digit on either side of the decimal). 

What you learn: basic lex syntax, regular expressions in lex, defining symbols for regular expressions, compiling and running
