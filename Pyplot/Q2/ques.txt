Question 2
        Write a python code to plot a line graph using the data present in the file “roofnet-noise11.txt”. 
Note: Follow the below instructions when plotting the graph. Please do not do anything extra apart from the instructions mentioned below.


1. Set a figure size of 10,6
2. Plot the line graphs for the columns 5%-ile, 95%-ile, Median (50%-ile) only in the mentioned order.
3. For the line graph corresponding to 5%-ile use:
   1. Color “red”
   2. Marker “x”
   3. Linestyle “solid”
4. For the line graph corresponding to 95%-ile use:
   1. Color “blue”
   2. Marker “+”
   3. Linestyle “dashed”
5. For the line graph corresponding to Median (50%-ile) use:
   1. Color “black”
   2. Marker circle
   3. Linestyle “dashdot”
6. Some common instructions for all three line graphs:
   1. Make sure that the markersize is set to 9
   2. Set the markeredgewidth to 2
   3. Make sure that the line width is set to 2
   4. Labels should be with the exact name as the corresponding column name.
7. The max value for y-axis should be set to -70
8. The legend should be displayed using the “best” location
9. Labels for x,y should be: “Reading Number” and “Silence Level (dBm)”
10. Code should save the figure as “output2.png”
11. Display the grid.
